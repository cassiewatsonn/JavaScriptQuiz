## Usage
When I click the start button on the quiz, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question to answer. When I answer the question, then I will be presented with another question. If I answer a question incorrectly then, time is subtracted from the clock. When, all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. When the game is over, then I can save my initials and my score to the scoreboard.
